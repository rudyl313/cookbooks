# My Cookbook Collection

I use the following chef cookbooks to provision various (mostly
vagrant-based) development environments. As such, they were written
to provision a particular technology on a Ubuntu LTS distribution
(either 10.04 Lucid or 12.04 Precise). Feel free to use them for your
own projects. I can't guarantee that they are in a working condition or
up to date, but they should be in a relatively useful. Post an issue if
you notice that anything isn't working.
